📚 Library Management System

A console-based Library Management System built in Java.
This project allows managing books and users, borrowing and returning books, tracking overdue items, and persisting data using CSV files.

🚀 Features

Book Management

View all books

Borrow and return books

Tracks borrowing user and borrow date

User Management

View all users

Store unique user IDs

Reports

Borrowed Books Report

Overdue Books Report (books borrowed for more than 14 days)

Input Validation

Prevents crashes from invalid input (InputMismatchException, NumberFormatException)

Data Persistence

All data is stored in CSV files for persistence between runs

Robust Console UI

Menu-driven system with safe input handling

🏗️ Technologies Used

Language: Java

IDE: VS Code / Eclipse

File Handling: BufferedReader, BufferedWriter

Java Time API: LocalDate, ChronoUnit for overdue calculation

Data Storage: CSV files

OOP Concepts: Encapsulation, composition, modular design

🛠️ Installation & Running

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git


Open in IDE (VS Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ)

Ensure CSV files exist under data/ folder:

data/books.csv
data/users.csv


CSV headers are required, e.g., # id,title,author,borrowed,userId,borrowDate

Run the program

java -cp bin library.Main

🧩 Project Structure

├─ Main.java         # Console UI
├─ Library.java      # Business logic
├─ Book.java         # Book model
├─ User.java         # User model
├─ FileManager.java  # File I/O

   └─ users.csv

📄 Sample CSV Format

books.csv

# id,title,author,borrowed,userId,borrowDate
1,The Alchemist,Paulo Coelho,false,-1,
2,1984,George Orwell,false,-1,


users.csv

# id,name
1,John Doe
2,Jane Smith

🎯 How it Works

Program starts and loads books/users from CSV.

Console menu allows the following actions:

View all books

Borrow a book

Return a book

View all users

Generate borrowed books report

Generate overdue books report

User input is validated to prevent crashes.

Changes are automatically saved to CSV files.

🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes with encapsulated data

Modular design

File Handling

Reading and writing CSV files

Exception Handling

Prevent InputMismatchException and NumberFormatException

Java Time API

Track borrowing and overdue days

Robust console interface

Menu system with input validation

🛠️ Future Improvements

Add a GUI (JavaFX/Swing)

Replace CSV files with a database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

Add user authentication

Implement book search and filter features

Add fines or penalties for overdue books
